**BREAKING NEWS:** USA, Spring 2020. March Madness, The Masters, and every Major League, minor league, high school, and youth sports league - shut down. All due to a pandemic caused by a 125 nanometer virus called COVID-19.

As people say these days, we live in unprecedented and uncertain times. 

Through it all, sports appear to still be a vital thread to the fabric of American culture. For many youth and high schoolers, sport is the major outlet for physical activity providing physical, mental and social benefits. For many adults, it provides a livelihood.

But, as we re-open America and return to what we have started to call “the new normal,” how do we go from at-home body weight workouts and driveway hoops (perhaps inspired by The Last Dance) to assembling with our team to practice, train, compete, and offer friendship? Or, for the opportunity to be a spectator or a sports parent and experience the joy of sports?

This question is definitely the hot topic and being asked not only in the sports arena but everywhere else–restaurants, the entertainment industry, schools, the workplace…everywhere.
